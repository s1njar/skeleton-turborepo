## Development

We follow the standard `Develop` > `Master` development workflow.

### Creating A Release

Creating a release takes place in Github:

1. Update CHANGELOG.md with the release information and next version number (see <https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/>)
2. Merge `develop` into `master` via Pull Request (DO **NOT** SQUASH COMMITS)
3. Create a new Release
4. Create a tag from `master` using the same version number from the updated CHANGELOG.md
5. Copy/paste the CHANGELOG.md release notes into the Github release notes
6. Click "Create Release"
7. Fetch the changes from Github via `git fetch origin`
8. Checkout the newly created tag e.g. `git checkout tags/v0.7.0`
9. Push your changes

## Components

To create a new component we use [hygen](https://github.com/jondot/hygen) in the background

### Colors

When adding new colors ensure it's named using one of the following tools:

- <https://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/>
- <https://github.com/guillaumedoutriaux/name-that-color>

## Architecture

## Husky

Pre-commit and pre-push hooks are managed via [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) in the main `package.json`

Tests and linting will be run before every commit and push.
